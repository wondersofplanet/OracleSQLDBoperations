To get a list of all tables in an Oracle database, you can query the system views based on your privileges. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **For All Tables Accessible by the Current User:**

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM user_tables;
```

This will return all tables that belong to the user currently logged in.

### 2. **For All Tables Accessible by the Current User Including Views and Synonyms:**

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM all_tables;
```

This will return all tables accessible by the user, including those owned by other users to which you have access.

### 3. **For All Tables in the Entire Database (DBA Privileges Required):**

```sql
SELECT table_name, owner 
FROM dba_tables;
```

This will return all tables in the database, but you need DBA privileges to run this query.
